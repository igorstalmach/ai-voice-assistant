# PL TTS GPT wrapper

## Description

## Installation

The app consists of two parts: the backend and the frontend.

WIP

### Backend (FastAPI)

You must have docker installed to run the backend. Refer to [TODO]().

`docker-compose build` to build the backend image.
then
`docker-compose up` to run the backend.

The project is set to run on port `8000`.

## Frontend (Expo)

We use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for simplicity and speed in working with monorepos. Refer to [pnpm docs](https://pnpm.io/installation) for installation instructions.

since the app is mobile you have to set your local ip address in `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `.env.local` file for development.

### Docs (?)

We may want to deploy the docs to github pages or smth.
